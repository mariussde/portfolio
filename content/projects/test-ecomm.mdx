# Development

## Backend Architecture

The backend was built using NestJS with TypeScript, following a clean architecture pattern with:

- Controllers for handling HTTP requests
- Services for business logic
- Models for type definitions
- Supabase integration for database operations

Tech stack:

- NestJS for the API
- Supabase for the database
- TypeScript for type safety
- Postman for API testing

## Frontend Implementation

Built with Next.js and TypeScript, the frontend features:

### 1. Landing Page with Featured Product
