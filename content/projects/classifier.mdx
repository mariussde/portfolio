# Overview of the project

This project is a straightforward implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch. The dataset comprises 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal is to train a CNN to achieve high accuracy in classifying these images.

## Key Features

1. **CNN Architecture**: Implements a simple CNN with two convolutional layers followed by three fully connected layers.
2. **Data Loading**: Utilizes PyTorch's `torchvision` to load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
3. **Training and Evaluation**: Trains the model using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and evaluates performance on test data.
4. **Prediction on New Images**: Provides functionality to classify new images using the trained model.
5. **Saving and Loading Models**: Saves the trained model to disk and allows loading for further predictions.
