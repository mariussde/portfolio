  description: "Hi, I'm Rudro Dip Sarker (Sumit) a.k.a rds - I program computers. I'm the founder of Sonicrypt, and one of the founding engineers of Leapflow. I also make electronic devices, robots, make videos, and write blogs. I don't have a niche, I'm a generalist. I work on web, mobile, desktop, server, embedded systems, IoT, blockchain, applied AI. I love physics, and computer science. And... I gaslight rocks ðŸª¨ to think ðŸ§ . (I watch anime too)",
